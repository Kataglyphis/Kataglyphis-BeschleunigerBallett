# GPU golden testing

The `GoldenRender.*` and `Integration.*` suites in
`Test/commit/VulkanEngine/` render real frames on a real GPU and assert on the
captured pixels. They are the end-to-end safety net for render- and
device-path changes that the CPU unit suites cannot cover.

## They skip without a GPU

Each of these tests begins with `SKIP_WITHOUT_GPU()` (or an equivalent
GLFW/Vulkan-runtime guard). In the headless container build
(`Scripts/Windows/Build-Windows-Container.ps1 -RunTests`) there is no GPU, so
they report **skipped**, not passed. A green container build therefore proves
the code *compiles and links* and that the CPU suites pass — it does **not**
prove a render/device refactor is behaviour-preserving.

## Running them on the host GPU

The container build delivers the built test executable back into the working
tree at `build-clangcl-debug/commitTestSuite.exe`. On a host with a GPU it runs
the golden tests for real. Invoke the executable directly — the host's `ctest`
cannot read the container-generated CMake tree — and run it **from the
repository root**:

```
cd <repo root>
./build-clangcl-debug/commitTestSuite.exe --gtest_filter='GoldenRender.*:Integration.*'
```

**The working directory matters.** The Slang-emitted SPIR-V shaders are loaded
via *cwd-relative* paths (e.g. `Resources/ShadersSlang/build/spirv/...`). Running
from `build-clangcl-debug/` fails with an access violation /
empty-`codeSize` `vkCreateShaderModule` — that is a wrong cwd, **not** a code
bug. Run from the repo root, where `Resources/` resolves.

The executable carries AddressSanitizer/UBSan (the debug config's flags); it
runs fine on the host.

## Rust WebGPU suite: requiring a GPU explicitly

The Rust renderer (`ExternalLib/Kataglyphis-RustProjectTemplate/crates/webgpu_renderer`)
has the same problem in miniature: its GPU tests guard on
`GpuContext::headless_or_skip()` and print `SKIP: no GPU adapter available in
this environment` and return early when no adapter is usable, so a skipped
test and a passing test are the same `ok` line in `cargo test` output. Set
`KATAGLYPHIS_REQUIRE_GPU=1` when running this host verification loop so a
missing/unusable adapter panics instead of silently skipping:

```
$env:KATAGLYPHIS_REQUIRE_GPU=1
cargo test -p kataglyphis_webgpu_renderer
```

A clean run has zero `SKIP: no GPU` lines in the output.

## The verification loop for render/device changes

This is the canonical per-unit verification pattern; `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/cpp-renderer-improvements.md` link here rather than restating it.

For a behaviour-preserving refactor of the record path, a pipeline, a device
feature, an image transition, or the loader upload path:

1. Build in the container: `Scripts/Windows/Build-Windows-Container.ps1
   -Configurations 'clangcl-debug'` (tar-pipe fallback on a Dev Drive, where
   bind mounts break). Fresh-container rule: `-FreshContainer` (after
   deleting the local build tree) is required after ANY module-interface
   change — `.ixx` member edits AND plain shared headers whose structs cross
   module boundaries (`ObjectDescription.hpp` taught this with an exit-3
   crash) — otherwise stale BMIs can ASan-fault at member init. Body-only
   `.cpp` and shader edits build incrementally.
2. Run the golden + integration suites on the host GPU (an RX 9070 XT here)
   as above.
3. Where rendering changed, add a validation-layer-clean runtime check: an
   8–10 s engine run with stderr captured, grepping the validation output.
4. All tests passing = the recorded frames are unchanged = the refactor is
   render-equivalent. As of 2026-08-01 the baseline is 29 runnable
   `GoldenRender` tests (30 defined, minus `DISABLED_DumpsFrameToPng`, which
   does not run by default) + 2 `Integration` tests = 31 total - see the
   machine-readable counts below, which
   `BuildIntegrity.GoldenTestCountsInDocsMatchTheSuite` pins against the
   suite source.

<!-- golden-counts: defined=30 runnable=29 integration=2 total=31 -->

This turns changes the container can only compile-check (device creation,
image barriers, the deferred/forward command streams, path/ray tracing) into
verifiable ones.

Shader-only units are cheap: edit a `.slang` source, run
`compile-slang-shaders.ps1` (Windows) / `compile-slang-shaders.sh` (Linux) to
refresh the compiled SPIR-V, then run one golden — no C++ rebuild needed.
The `BuildIntegrity` tests check each `.spv` is not older than its `.slang`
source. Note the output tree (`Resources/ShadersSlang/build/`) is **gitignored,
not committed** — a fresh clone must run the compile script once before the
engine has anything to load (see
[`shader-build-pipeline.md`](shader-build-pipeline.md)).

## Writing a new golden test — cautions learned the hard way

This is the single home for these instrument cautions;
`docs/cpp-renderer-improvements.md` and `docs/path-tracing.md` link here.
The suite's own comments document the expensive mistakes; heed them:

- **Captures are tonemapped**, and the **ImGui overlay is composited into
  them**. The opaque ImGui panel covers the LEFT ~70% of the 1200x768 test
  frame — the panel-free right edge (x >= 0.72w) is the scene. A pixel
  classifier written against raw scene colours (e.g. `r < 60 && b < 60`) can
  silently measure only the overlay, and whole-frame or centre-crop means
  have measured, at various times: the FPS-counter digits, SSAO, the
  caster's own body, and nothing at all. Crop away from the overlay (the
  existing tests crop to the right/lower scene region) and prefer
  luminance-delta oracles over absolute-colour thresholds.
- **Prefer counting to averaging for sparse signals.** Changed-pixel /
  swung-pixel / detail fractions discriminate where means drown (a UNORM
  ceiling clamps, a texture is near-greyscale, a skeleton is 3% of the
  frame).
- **A count says how much changed; only the shape says whether what changed is
  the effect.** Always capture an unconditional control (the effect disabled)
  and a same-state noise reference in the same run, and compare against them.
  Dump amplified diff-map PNGs and *look* at them before trusting any new
  pixel metric: `GoldenRender.DISABLED_DumpsFrameToPng` dumps the frame, the
  control, and an amplified difference to PNG — use it
  (`--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests --gtest_filter=*DumpsFrameToPng*`,
  `KATAGLYPHIS_FRAME_DUMP=out`) to see what a metric is really measuring.

Effects with no runtime toggle (the tonemap is always on) are hard to isolate
this way: "compressed vs clipped" is ambiguous without a control, so a robust
oracle must key on a property the effect uniquely produces (e.g. retained
variation), not just "brighter" or "darker".

## Synchronization validation

The golden/integration suites above catch behaviour-visible regressions;
Vulkan's `khronos_validation.validate_sync` layer setting catches a
different class of bug that a pixel oracle cannot see: a missing or
incorrect barrier between two GPU commands that read or write the same
resource (WRITE-AFTER-WRITE, READ-AFTER-WRITE, WRITE-AFTER-READ). It found
10 real WRITE-AFTER-WRITE hazards in July 2026. It is expensive (extra
per-command tracking), which is why it is off by default and not part of
the debug build's normal validation layers.

Run it after touching render passes, barriers, or frames-in-flight:

```
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Scripts\Windows\Run-SyncValidation.ps1
```

This builds on the same `commitTestSuite.exe` as above (repo root or
`build-clangcl-debug\`, same working-directory requirement), copies
`Scripts/vk_layer_settings.txt` next to it for the duration of the run (the
Vulkan loader reads `vk_layer_settings.txt` from the CWD or the executable's
directory - there is no path env var for it), and exits non-zero with a
per-hazard summary if the run's log contains `SYNC-HAZARD`. Deliberately not
wired into CI, for the same reason as the golden suites: the GPU is required
and unavailable there.

## Known issue: path-tracing compute device-lost on the large dinosaur mesh

`GoldenRender.PathTracingAccumulatesAndConverges`,
`GoldenRender.GuiInputSweepNeverCrashesOrLosesTheDevice` and
`Integration.RenderModesSelectableInGui` currently hard-abort
(`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`, zero preceding validation errors) on the RX 9070 XT
when path tracing runs against the shipped debug scene
(`Models/Dinosaurs/dinosaurs.obj`, hundreds of thousands of vertices). Root
cause is not yet found (needs GPU capture tooling — RenderDoc/PIX/AMD crash
dumps — not available here); see the "Localize (and fix if cheap) the
path-tracing compute `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`" entry in `BACKLOG.md` for the
full bisection.

As of 2026-07-31 the bug is confirmed scoped to `path_tracing.slang`/RayQuery
compute specifically, not the shared vertex-upload/buffer-device-address
path: `GoldenRender.RaytracedLargeMeshDoesNotLoseTheDevice` raytraces the
identical dinosaur mesh through the RT *pipeline* (`raytrace.rchit.slang`,
same `Vertices*` BDA read pattern) and does not lose the device. Excluding
the three tests above with
`--gtest_filter='GoldenRender.*:Integration.*:-GoldenRender.PathTracingAccumulatesAndConverges:GoldenRender.GuiInputSweepNeverCrashesOrLosesTheDevice:Integration.RenderModesSelectableInGui'`
runs the rest of the suite (28 tests) clean (verified 2026-08-01 on the RX 9070 XT —
"28 tests from 2 test suites ran", "PASSED 28 tests", 1 `DISABLED_` test not run).
