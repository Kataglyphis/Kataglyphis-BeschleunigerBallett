#!/usr/bin/env bash
# gcc-toolchain-root.sh - print the GCC prefix Clang should be pointed at.
#
# The shell counterpart of the auto-detection in CMakeLists.txt, for the steps
# that invoke clang++ DIRECTLY (no CMake, no preset) and so cannot inherit the
# --gcc-toolchain flags CMake computes.
#
# Why this exists at all: the prefix used to be written out literally as
# /opt/gcc-16.1.0 - in the presets and in Linux.yml. When the build image
# bumped GCC 16.1.0 -> 16.2.0 that path stopped existing, and every Linux job
# died in compiler detection with
#
#   /usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-ld.bfd: cannot find crtbeginS.o
#
# which names neither the flag nor the version. A version-keyed path must be
# discovered, never hardcoded: ContainerHub installs GCC at
# /opt/gcc-${GCC_VERSION} (linux/scripts/01-core/cross-gcc.sh) and bumps
# GCC_VERSION whenever it likes.
#
# Selection order:
#   1. MYPROJECT_GCC_TOOLCHAIN_PATH  - explicit override.
#   2. GCC_PREFIX                    - the build image EXPORTS this
#                                      (=/opt/gcc-16.2.0 today, set from
#                                      GCC_VERSION); it is the authoritative
#                                      answer whenever we are in the container.
#   3. the NEWEST /opt/gcc-* that actually contains crtbeginS.o.
# The last condition is the point of step 3: a prefix that cannot supply the
# startup objects is not a usable toolchain, so it must not be selected merely
# for existing.
#
# Prints the prefix on stdout. Exits 1 with a diagnostic on stderr if none is
# usable, so a caller running under `set -e` stops here rather than silently
# analysing against the system GCC's headers.
