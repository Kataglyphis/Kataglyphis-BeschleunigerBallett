.SYNOPSIS
Runs the GPU golden/integration test suites with Vulkan synchronization
validation enabled and fails if the log contains a SYNC-HAZARD.

.DESCRIPTION
Turns the manual "hand-write a vk_layer_settings.txt, point VK_LAYER_PATH at
the SDK, run the suite, eyeball the log for SYNC-HAZARD" procedure described
in BACKLOG.md ("Recurring validation runs" -> "Synchronization validation")
into one command. That procedure found 10 real WRITE-AFTER-WRITE hazards in
July 2026; in practice nobody re-runs a manual procedure, so this exists to
make it something a "before touching render passes/barriers/frames-in-flight"
habit can actually be.

Thin wrapper: the generic driver (staging vk_layer_settings.txt next to the
executable and removing it again, VK_LAYER_PATH save/restore, running the
target, scanning the log, reporting hazard counts) lives upstream in
third_party/ContainerHub/windows/scripts/modules/WindowsVulkanValidation.Common.psm1
and is reusable by any Vulkan project. Only this project's executable, gtest
filter, SDK path and log location are supplied here.

Deliberately NOT wired into CI: the GoldenRender/Integration suites need a
GPU and skip everywhere except a host with one (see docs/gpu-golden-testing.md),
so a CI gate here would be vacuous. Run it locally instead, the same way
scripts/Compare-PerfBaseline.ps1 is a local-only tool.

.PARAMETER ExecutablePath
Path to the built commitTestSuite.exe. Defaults to the repo root, falling
back to build-clangcl-debug\ (where the container build script leaves it).

.PARAMETER GtestFilter
Passed through as --gtest_filter. Defaults to the two GPU suites.

.PARAMETER VulkanSdkBin
Directory containing the Khronos validation layer. Defaults to the SDK
version documented in AGENTS.md.

.PARAMETER LogDir
Where the tee'd run log is written, one timestamped file per run.

.PARAMETER LogFixturePath
Test-only escape hatch: skip running the executable entirely and just
evaluate an existing log file for SYNC-HAZARD lines, then exit accordingly.
Exists so the exit-code contract (non-zero iff a hazard is present) can be
Pester-tested without a GPU - see scripts/windows/tests/Invoke-SyncValidation.Tests.ps1.
