# Guards against generated artifacts sneaking into this repo's git index.
#
# The check is generic and was upstreamed on 2026-08-07 to ContainerHub's
# WindowsRepoHygiene.Common (Get-TrackedIgnoredFile, with its own suite). Only
# this repo's root stays here.
#
# Why it exists: `docs/build/` was excluded by .gitignore (twice, in fact - a
# duplicate rule at both line 11 and line 85) yet 21 files under it plus a stray
# __pycache__/*.pyc were already tracked, because .gitignore only stops NEW
# files from being added - it does nothing once a path is already indexed. The
# result: git kept serving a two-month-stale docs/build/html/ that CI
# regenerates from scratch on every run.
#
# Deliberately the general gate, not a docs/build-specific one: any future
# generated artifact that lands in the index while also being gitignored fails
# it too.
#
# NOTE: written for Pester 3.4.0 (what the Windows lane pins) - no BeforeAll
# outside Describe, and the dash-less assertion syntax.
