# Guards this repo's copies of the shared tool configs against drift.
#
# .clang-format, .clang-tidy, gcovr.cfg and .pre-commit-config.yaml are owned by
# ContainerHub (shared/config/). They are COPIED here rather than referenced
# because clang-format, clang-tidy and pre-commit find their config by walking
# UP from the file being processed - a config inside the submodule is never
# found, and deleting the local copy would silently stop format-on-save in every
# editor while CI kept passing. See shared/config/README.md upstream.
#
# So the copies stay and this makes drift impossible instead of unnoticed:
# edit upstream, then re-run the sync script with -Write.
#
# NOTE: written for Pester 3.4.0 (what the Windows lane pins) - no BeforeAll
# outside Describe, and the dash-less assertion syntax.
