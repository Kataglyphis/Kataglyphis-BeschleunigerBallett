/// bookkeeping, the findMesh()+unknownBounds fallback, transformAABB, the
/// considered/drawn counters, and the bind-VB/bind-IB/drawIndexed sequence -
/// while leaving genuine per-caller differences to the two callbacks:
///
/// - `onModel(modelMatrix)` runs once per model, before its meshes. Forward
///   rasterization uses it to seed the push constant's model/invModelRows;
///   the shadow pass has nothing model-level to precompute and passes a
///   no-op.
/// - `shouldCull(worldBounds)` runs once per mesh (after `onModel`, before
///   any draw-related side effect) and returning true skips the mesh.
///   Forward rasterization tests one camera frustum; the shadow pass unions
///   `isVisibleAsShadowCaster` over every cascade.
/// - `onMesh(modelMatrix, objectIndex, mesh)` runs once per surviving mesh,
///   before the shared bind+draw. It is where each caller pushes its own
///   push-constant type/content (`PushConstantRasterizer` with
///   inverse-transpose rows and the dynamic `setCullMode`, vs
///   `ShadowPushConstants` with no cull-mode toggle since the shadow
///   pipeline is built `eCullMode = eNone`).
///
/// `mesh` passed to `shouldCull`'s bounds and to `onMesh` may be null (a
/// findMesh() miss); the shared walk treats a null mesh as an empty draw
/// (unknown bounds, zero-size vertex/index buffers) rather than skipping it,
/// matching the callers' former inline behaviour.
